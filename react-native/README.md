## Getting Started with the React Native Project using Expo

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have installed:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI

### Installation

**Install the dependencies**

Navigate to the 'vindral-webview-example' directory and run the following command:
`npm install`

For dependencies like `react-native-google-cast` that add custom native code, you need to run the following command:
`npx expo prebuild`

**Run the project**

Start the project using Expo:
